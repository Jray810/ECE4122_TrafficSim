# Project Description
This project is a simulation of a four way traffic intersection and a measurement of traffic flow across the intersection. This project was inspired by MITâ€™s Senseable City Lab - Light Traffic (http://senseable.mit.edu/light-traffic/). The project investigates and compares the traffic flow between existing Stop-Sign infrastructure and fully Autonomous intersection control. Ultimately, this project has the potential to be used as a possible framework for future investigations into autonomous traffic intersections.

A video demonstration of the existing project can be found here: 

# Project Operation Instructions
This project is in C++ and requires a G++ compiler as well as OpenMP and SFML support.

All commands below are run in the main folder. We used Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows WSL and installed XMing for graphical support.

#
To compile the simulation simply do:
```
$ make
```
or
```
$ g++ code/*.h code/*.cpp sfmlDisplay.cpp -lpthread -fopenmp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o trafficSim
```

#
To run the simulation, make sure you start XMing first:
```
$ export DISPLAY=:0.0
$ ./trafficSim [-T] [-R] [-P]
```

# Makefile Commands:
To compile simulation for SFML display with executable trafficSim, run:
```
$ make all
```
To compile simulation for no display debugging testing, make sure you set DEBUG to 1 in the debugSetup.h file, then compile with:
```
$ make testing
```
To clean up unwanted executables and compilation files:
```
$ make clean
```

# Known Issues
Light Controlled - Traffic Controller: Currently not supported. Pending future development if time allows.

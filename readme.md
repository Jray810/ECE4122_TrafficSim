The Makefile contains the following commands:

$make all    # compiles main.cpp and all headers, executable in a.out

$make trafficSim    # same effect as make all

$make testing   # compiles testing.cpp instead of main.cpp, and all headers. Executable in a.out

$make clean     # removes a.out and all \*.gch files
